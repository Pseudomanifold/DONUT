  This is a database of applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">Topological Data Analysis</a>, 
  an emerging mathematical paradigm for performing multi-scale analyses
  of complex data sets.

    <h1>Where is the data coming from?</h1>

    <p>
      The source for all articles in this database is a bibliographical database maintained by <a href="https://www.bgiunti.info">Barbara Giunti</a>, and created in 2020 together with <a href="http://www.jlazovskis.com/">JƒÅnis Lazovskis</a>.
      This database is currently accessible via <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/2425412/tda-applications">Zotero</a>.
      This service indexes the database daily to provide a full-text
      search over individual articles, authors, and tags.

    <h1>How can I report erroneous data?</h1>

    <p>
      To report an error in an article, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:donut@topology.rocks">donut@topology.rocks</a>.
      We are working on providing a direct feedback opportunity for
      database articles as well.

    <h1>What types of articles are included in the database?</h1>

    <p>
      This database is supposed to focus on <em>applications</em> of
      topological data analysis. Our primary goal is to show that this
      exciting emerging area of research has real-world applications and
      can be employed in different contexts. Thus, we are purposefully
      focusing on including articles that are potentially accessible to
      domain experts. We know that from the outside, topological data
      analysis may look daunting, but by showcasing applications, we
      hope to inspire new people about this research.

    <h1>Why is my article missing?</h1>

    <p>
      To report a missing article, please contact us at <a href="mailto:donut@topology.rocks">donut@topology.rocks</a>.
      It is easiest to provide a BibTeX entry of your article to
      the inclusion into the database.
